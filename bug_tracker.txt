1. trilla babies can appear in walls (and stay stuck there until killed)

2. pausing (via dialog) while taking damage blurs the health bar up across the screen

3. enemies using Teleport can warp into hidden rooms

5. stand next to an interactable so text box appears. then pause and unpause game. the text box will stay there forever.

6. in the menus, if you reassign the movement keys, it also reassigns the menu navigation keys, which is kind of awkward. There should be dedicated menu nav keys.
