[bugs]

 - can equip items/mess with inv while perfoming other actions
    - should implement this as an action
 - can't right-click a potion while dialog is active
    - dialog should advance when you click basically anywhere, right?
 - when inventory rebuilds, sometimes artifacts appear on the screen for a frame
    - probably a graphics card issue honestly
 - "ValueError: failed to place start anywhere on path"
    - slightly fixed this by making the "start" feature less restrictive
    - still need logic to re-attempt the generation without crashing
 - when you die with an item on the cursor, it stays on cursor through death sequence
    - not a huge deal, but should probably at least hide the image
 - offscreen light sources that are somewhat nearby will make offscreen enemies act non-instantly
    - which is annoying
    
 - world gen issues:
     - npcs can block path
     - can still spawn in a detached room (see bad_spawn.png)

 - fullscreen issues:
    - in fullscreen mode, when mouse cursor becomes hidden, it snaps back to that 
        position when it becomes unhidden. i blame pygame for this
    - lots of issues with full-screen on Windows (on dk's jank-ass machine anyways)
 
[current features]
 - level generation
    - enemy generation
 - choose name for game   
 - game needs an end
 - game needs a 'give feedback' button in-game (link to a google doc is probably fine)
 - title screen needs to be animated, otherwise game feels frozen when you open it
 - better animation when you interact with the level-end door
    - door starts opening when you activate, screen fades to black
    - next level generates while screen is black
    - next level fades off of black
 
 
[game name]
    Cubelike
        - blend of roguelike and "cube" (?)
        - been using this as the name since the begining
        - don't really want to use word "Cube" because it's awkward to say/hard to hear
            - "it's called kyubelike"
            - what?
            - "it's cube-like, like roguelike, if you pronounce it wrong"
    
    Skeletris
        - very close to "Dungetris" which is an existing tetris-infused indie roguelike
    
    Slap Monsters, Find Loot
        - cute, memorable, 2nd half needs work
        - hate the word "loot"
        - "ess em eff ell" sucks
        - 
    Slap Monster, Get Treasure
        - pros:
            - "ess em gee tee", pretty good, acronym available
            - sounds like lgbt
            - describes all important parts of the game
        - cons:
            - ambiguously necessary comma
            - ambiguously necessary "s" after Monster
            - it's pretty stupid
        
[future features]

 - design and implement interesting stats
 - one boss fight 
 - magic system
 - actual dialog for NPCs
 - quest system
 - description text for each decoration
 - some indicator that enemies are still acting
 - when you activate or hover over a keymapped attack, it should show the attack range
 
 
[~dream features~]
 - see notes app on phone
 - many boss fights
 - animated text in TextImages ~wavy language~
 - farming
 
[bugs that are fine]
 - when you pop a dialog, player keeps current animation (most noticeable if walking)
