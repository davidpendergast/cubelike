[bugs]

 - can have rooms that border out-of-bounds with no walls in between
 - npcs can block path
 - going to next zone while inventory is open leaves some sprites behind, "LVL: " in particular
 - when you pop a dialog, player keeps current animation (most noticeable if walking)
    - fine? adds character
 - can pickup items/mess with inv while perfoming other actions
 - should clear player controller when a new world is spawned
 - dialog & inventory fight to render on top of each other (dialog should win)
 - can still spawn in a detached room (see bad_spawn.png)
 - in fullscreen mode, when mouse cursor becomes hidden, it snaps back to that position when it becomes unhidden
 - pressing an arrow key while dialog is showing will hide dialog AND perform the action   
    - it should just hide
 - when hit from above, you turn to face right
