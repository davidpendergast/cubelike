[bugs]

 - can equip items/mess with inv while perfoming other actions
    - should implement this as an action
 - when inventory rebuilds, sometimes artifacts appear on the screen for a frame
    - probably a graphics card issue honestly
        - this is pretty wishful thinking lol 

 - OS issues:
    - lots of issues with full-screen on Windows (on dk's jank-ass machine anyways)
    - gotta setup my windows machine to test, probably need to handle resolution scaling issues
    - linux-style colored console text is an epic fail on windows
  
 
[current features]
 - level generation
    - add auto-retry logic _just_in_case_ level generation fails
    - enemy generation
        - specific item pools for enemies
        - besides adding more enemies 
 - certain features should be once-per-level
    - like no duplicate NPCs probably
 - enemies equipping / picking up items (intelligence >= 4)
 - enemies consuming / throwing items (intelligence >= 5)
 - game needs an end
    - for now, maybe zone 16 is just the Frog Boss fight, and after it dies, credits roll?
    - not really a boss fight, so it's fine
 - better animation when you interact with the level-end door
    - door starts opening when you activate, screen fades to black
    - next level generates while screen is black
    - next level fades off of black
 - specific dialog pools for each NPC
        
        
[future features]

 - design and implement interesting stats
 - one boss fight 
 - cinematic stuff (these are currently broken fyi)
 - magic system
 - actual dialog for NPCs
 - quest system
 - description text for each decoration
 - some indicator that enemies are still acting
 - when you activate or hover over a keymapped attack, it should show the attack range
 - in-game map (toggle ascii overlay)
 - fade to black between zones / menus
 - title screen needs to be animated, otherwise game feels frozen when you open it
 - permanent effects (aka curses)
 
 
[~dream features~]
 - many boss fights
 - animated text in TextImages ~wavy language~
    - reconsider, according to twitter this will kill the game
 - farming
    - if you can dream it you can meme it
 
 
[bugs that are fine]
    - when you pop a dialog, player keeps current animation (most noticeable if walking)
    - offscreen light sources that are somewhat nearby will make offscreen enemies act non-instantly
        - for now, let's just not have any enemies that emit light by default
        

[game name]

    [CAN'T USE] Cubelike 
        - blend of roguelike and "cube" (?)
        - been using this as the name since the begining
        - don't really want to use word "Cube" because it's awkward to say/hard to hear
            - "it's called kyubelike"
            - what?
            - "it's cube-like, like roguelike, if you pronounce it wrong"
    
    Skeletris
        - pros:
            - sounds cool
            - available
            - this can also be the name of the city in which the game takes place
        - cons:
            - similar to "Dungetris" which is an existing indie tetris-roguelike fusion
                - games are totally different though, probably fine to use
            - says basically nothing about the game except "there are skeletons + tetris"
            - there are like four ppl using this name on social media accounts
    
    Slap Monsters, Find Loot
        - cute, memorable, 2nd half needs work
        - hate the word "loot"
        - SMFL = "ess em eff ell" sucks
        
    Slap Monster, Get Treasure
        - pros:
            - SMGT = "ess em gee tee", pretty good, acronym available
            - sounds like lgbt
            - describes all important parts of the game
        - cons:
            - ambiguously necessary comma
            - ambiguously necessary "s" after Monster
            - it's too stupid
            - one day later, i hate it
            
    [CAN'T USE] Tomb of the Mushroom King
        - cons:
            - identical to "Crypt of the Fungal Lord", which exists
            - similar to "Curse of the Mushroom King", which exists
