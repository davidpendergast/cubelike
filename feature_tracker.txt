[bugs]

 - when you pop a dialog, player keeps current animation (most noticeable if walking)
    - fine? adds character
 - can pickup items/mess with inv while perfoming other actions
    - this is kinda hard to fix
    - it has some gameplay consequences too, like the player can instantly swap 
        between gear between attacking / defending.
    - i think for now, we probably just need to leave it, hard to fix without 
        hurting UX during normal play.
 - can't right-click a potion while dialog is active
 - item entities bob down a little too far, below their own shadows
 - when inventory rebuilds, sometimes artifacts appear on the screen for a frame
    - probably a graphics card issue honestly
 - "ValueError: failed to place start anywhere on path"
    - slightly fixed this by making the "start" feature less restrictive
    - still need logic to re-attempt the generation without crashing
 - should turn around when you drop an item behind yourself
    
 - world gen issues:
     - npcs can block path
     - can still spawn in a detached room (see bad_spawn.png)

 - fullscreen issues:
    - in fullscreen mode, when mouse cursor becomes hidden, it snaps back to that 
        position when it becomes unhidden
    - lots of issues with full-screen on Windows (on dk's jank-ass machine anyways)
