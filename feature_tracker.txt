[bugs]

 - when you pop a dialog, player keeps current animation (most noticeable if walking)
    - fine? adds character
 - can equip items/mess with inv while perfoming other actions
    - should implement this as an action
 - can't right-click a potion while dialog is active
 - item entities bob down a little too far, below their own shadows
 - when inventory rebuilds, sometimes artifacts appear on the screen for a frame
    - probably a graphics card issue honestly
 - "ValueError: failed to place start anywhere on path"
    - slightly fixed this by making the "start" feature less restrictive
    - still need logic to re-attempt the generation without crashing
    
 - world gen issues:
     - npcs can block path
     - can still spawn in a detached room (see bad_spawn.png)

 - fullscreen issues:
    - in fullscreen mode, when mouse cursor becomes hidden, it snaps back to that 
        position when it becomes unhidden
    - lots of issues with full-screen on Windows (on dk's jank-ass machine anyways)
 
[current features]
 - when you activate or hover over a keymapped attack, it should show the attack range
