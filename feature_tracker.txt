[bugs]

 - can have rooms that border out-of-bounds with no walls in between
 - npcs can block path
 - going to next zone while inventory is open leaves some sprites behind, "LVL: " in particular
 - sometimes enemies will alternate turns with you even when their speed is two...
    - i think?? anyways it feels really wonky
 - (intentionally) removed ability to consume items via right-click
 - when you pop a dialog, player keeps current animation (most noticeable if walking)
 - tooltips aren't constrained to screen (heavyweight tooltips?? pygame pls)
 - can pickup items/mess with inv while perfoming other actions
 - should clear player controller when a new world is spawned
 - dialog & inventory fight to render on top of each other (dialog should win)
