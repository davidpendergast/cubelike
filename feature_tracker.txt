[bugs]

 - possible for spawn to be disconnected from rest of dungeon, see enclosed_spawn.png
    - also can have rooms that border out-of-bounds with no walls in between
    - npcs can block path
    - actually a lot of wonkiness here
 - single pixel player jiggle when walking vertically (sometimes)
 - File "/home/david/Coding/python/cubelike/src/worldgen/worldgen2.py", line 291, in set
        ValueError: tile is None at (6, 36)
 - "target selector" entities remain onscreen after player has died
 - going to next zone while inventory is open leaves some sprites behind, "LVL: " in particular
        
 ~NEED TO WORK THIS OUT BEFORE CONTINUING~

[action-use design]
 - at any point in time, actors have a set of 'available actions'
    - these include basic actions (like moving, interacting, skipping)
        as well as actions granted by items and other effects.
 - some actions have dedicated hotkeys (like moving = WASD)
 - some actions are 'mappable' meaning they can be bound to keys 1-6
 - actions granted by items can be activated by right clicking the item and 
        selecting the action from a dropdown list.
        
 - hotbar
    - by default, only mapped action is UNARMED_ATTACK=1
    - when you obtain/equip an item with mappable actions, those actions will
        fill any empty hotbar slots. when you unequip, they become vacant again.
        this is considered a "soft mapping". 
    - you can also right-click a hotbar slot and select an available mappable 
        action to map to that slot (or unmap it). this is a "hard mapping".
    - soft mappings can be auto-overridden, and hard mappings can't.
    - slot 1 is the "auto-attack slot". when you move into an enemy, if there's 
        an attack in slot one, it is automatically used on the enemy. 
    
    - pressing a hotkey
        - if the action doesn't require targeting, or there is only one valid
            target, the action is used instantly.
        - if the action requires targeting, targeting mode activates
            [targeting mode]
                ~todo~
