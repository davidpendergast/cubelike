[bugs]

 - going to next zone while inventory is open leaves some sprites behind, "LVL: " in particular
 - when you pop a dialog, player keeps current animation (most noticeable if walking)
    - fine? adds character
 - can pickup items/mess with inv while perfoming other actions
    - this is kinda hard to fix
    - it has some gameplay consequences too, like the player can instantly swap 
        between gear between attacking / defending.
    - i think for now, we probably just need to leave it, hard to fix without 
        hurting UX during normal play.
 - when hit from above, you turn to face right
 - pickup entities bob down a little too far, below their own shadows
 - when inventory rebuilds, sometimes artifacts appear on the screen for a frame
    - probably a graphics card issue honestly
    
 - world gen issues:
     - can have rooms that border out-of-bounds with no walls in between 
        - haven't seen this in a while, maybe fixed
     - npcs can block path
     - can still spawn in a detached room (see bad_spawn.png)

 - fullscreen issues:
    - in fullscreen mode, when mouse cursor becomes hidden, it snaps back to that 
        position when it becomes unhidden
    - lots of issues with full-screen on windows (on dk's jank-ass machine anyways)
