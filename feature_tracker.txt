[bugs]

 - when you pop a dialog, player keeps current animation (most noticeable if walking)
    - fine? adds character
 - can equip items/mess with inv while perfoming other actions
    - should implement this as an action
 - can't right-click a potion while dialog is active
    - dialog should skip when you click basically anywhere, right?
 - when inventory rebuilds, sometimes artifacts appear on the screen for a frame
    - probably a graphics card issue honestly
 - "ValueError: failed to place start anywhere on path"
    - slightly fixed this by making the "start" feature less restrictive
    - still need logic to re-attempt the generation without crashing
 - when you die with an item on the cursor, it stays on cursor through death sequence
 - offscreen light sources that are nearby will make enemies act non-instantly, which is a annoying
    
 - world gen issues:
     - npcs can block path
     - can still spawn in a detached room (see bad_spawn.png)

 - fullscreen issues:
    - in fullscreen mode, when mouse cursor becomes hidden, it snaps back to that 
        position when it becomes unhidden
    - lots of issues with full-screen on Windows (on dk's jank-ass machine anyways)
 
[current features]
 - when you activate or hover over a keymapped attack, it should show the attack range
 - level generation
    - chest loot generation
 - choose name for game
    
 - enemy generation
 - some indicator that enemies are still acting
 - game needs an end
 - title screen needs to be animated, otherwise game feels frozen
 
 
[game name]
    Cubelike
        - blend of roguelike and "cube"?
        - don't really want to use word "Cube" because it's awkward to say
    Skeletris
        - very close to "Dungetris" which is an existing tetris-infused roguelike
    
    Slap Monsters, Find Loot
        - cute, memorable, 2nd half needs work
        - hate the word "loot"
        - "ess em eff ell" sucks
        - 
    Slap Monster, Get Treasure
        - "ess em gee tee", pretty good, acronym available
        - ambiguously necessary comma
