 - KeronCyst (comment on itch)
    - font is too small
        - possibly fullscreening will fix this?
    - saving system isn't well explained
        - true

    Drifty:
        "An RPG, but the gimmick is that it's like Tetris"
         - went through sound + controls menu first
         - kind of implied that I had paid $20 to have my game played (???)
            - very weird, not sure if it was intentional
            - "if you'd like to see your game played too, you can pay $25 or enter a contest"
        "I have no idea what engine they used, if any, it might just be some 
         libraries and c++ or something" - lol
         - went through all controls + inventory before starting
         - liked the map!
         "8-bit music"
         "our equipment is lego - err Tetris"
         - first item went very well
         "this is interesting, I like it already"
         "can I rotate this at all?"
         - tried to slot the potion into the hotbar, and it didn't work
         - kept trying to put the dagger in the hotbar... but it was locked
            - figured it out, like instantly
         - put the potion in the equipment grid, expected it to appear in
             hotbar. and it didn't. (this is quite a sensible idea honestly lol)
             "aparently it lets me"
         - "[i] doesn't appear to open the inventory"
            - this guy is making me feel dumb
            - saw the tooltip though
            - "i but you push R is a little confusing"
         
         - OK, so there was a small muncher, with 8 hp, he hit it for 7, then
           another small muncher threw a healing potion at it, which dealt one 
           damage, killing it  --> "oh, so ghosts are weak to healing potions"
           
            MMMssdfmsmmMMM not good~~
            
         - seemed to enjoy the tetis inventory the first time it got tough!
            - and chat did too
            
         - equipped two daggers, "does that give me more damage, I don't think
            it does"  - phew
         - tried to throw, couldn't figure it out
         
         - "I like it, I'm not gunna lie. And the music is good, a little repetitive, but I'm 
            not sick of it"
            
         - do we level up?
         - "the simple art style is good"
         - "all the weapons are the same, that's a little disappointing"
         - "tried to grab the mushrooms after the "
         - "ah it's a bank of mushrooms, that's the currency"
            - he gets it!
         - the %66.6 made him wonder whether you lose %66.6 of your items,
            - that's interesting. potentially not a bad idea?
         - did not see the slug's status effect
         - the "Press [m] to open Map." tutorial stayed onscreen literally forever..
            - because he couldn't see it?
         - it's a cool game, I actually really like it
         - when you die, it should respawn you, but take some kind of currency 
           from you. stay where you were, maybe take one item randomly. ok so I'm
           basically back where I was 10 minutes ago, that's not fun. And it doesn't
           let you go back and save it? that's the problem with it. Should 
           let the player exit the dungeon whenever they want to go back and
           save it, and or add experience because lets face it the idea behind this
           game is you wanna make your character stonger, keep that whole pieces 
           idea, really good idea there, there's a lot to be desired here, maybe
           an experience system, as you get more levels your equipment expands
           3x3 -> 4x4 -> 5x5. fantastic first look, love it, pretty good.
         
    Chat:
        "Minimalistic title screen"
        "anyoing but fun at the same time... hard to say x,D" - on inventory
        "creative idea. I kind of like it"
        "I really like the art style, too!"
        "Really well done in a cool style."
        "Reminds me of the original Rogue, except the graphics are more 
         than just letters on screen, a few dots to indicate walls, and 
         a 5 by 4 pixel smily face or whatever to indicate the player."
         "Why does that fat guy look like Fat Papyrus"
         "the writing is pretty good too"
         "Fun stuff! Great job, dev!"

 - Game Curator (through DMs, i sent a thank you message, and he replied:)
    "About your game: I wasn't really frustrated overall, though I appreciated 
     that you afterwards posted some gameplay hints on itch. The only thing I 
     was confused about was the controls, as I struggled with the E and R keys. 
     In my head it felt more natural to use the R key to rotate instead of 
     opening the inventory.

     I was aware about the map function, because I played the first three levels 
     before I actually decided to record a little playthrough. But the levels 
     had a great size, so I thought that I won't need it and instead explore a 
     bit to see if I missed any enemies. :D"

     Yeah, I should have used the weapons more often, touchÃ©. :) But bumping 
     into the creatures was more fun to me, hahaha.

     I am glad it helped you out in some ways. And I hope that your game will 
     be played a bit more often now - it definitely deserves more attention. 
     Great work, Ghast!"

 - Game Curator (wrote an article + made video! 1/27/2020 v1.0.0)
    - article:
        - very positive
        - thought MC was a skeleton (they're a HUSK, not a skeleton!!)
            - it's not really that important, but could consider adding some 
              more dialog to explain this. kinda relevant to the "lore" 
              OH WAIT, the game actually never calls you a husk...
              I thought mary did, but she does not lmao
        - "innovative inventory and status points system"
        - "As 'Skeletris' is a somewhat addictive roguelike adventure without
           annoying permadeath, neat boss fights and really intriguing core
           design, I simply have to highly recommend it to you. A wonderful job."
    - video:
        - learned the controls / gameplay a bit off-camera beforehand (much appreciated!)
        - some mistakes:
            - clicked the "skip" button every time, instead of pressing space
                - i assume he tried clicking it before ever being shown the tutorial
                - which means he'd never be shown the tutorial at depth 3 or whatever
                - this is not good UX        
            - filled equipment grid with daggers, even though it gives no benefit to have > 1
            - never right-clicked to insta-pickup stuff
                - it's never taught in game, after all
            - didn't click-to-replace items (it's never really taught...)
                - started doing this naturally after a while
            - equipped the sword, but didn't actually use it, because a dagger was still active
                - equipment grid was still full of daggers... lol
            - frequently pressed "R", when he wanted to rotate, which closed the inventory
                - this tapered off after a little while
            - never really opened the map. not sure why.
            - facetanked the crabs every time
            - double applied a health potion
            - couldn't figure out how to activate the whip
                - CRITICAL UI ISSUE
            - first death at the swamps, fighting two slugs a the same time without kiting them
            - status effects didn't seem to register
            - didn't hover over enemies to get info about them
            - even after kiting the spider perfectly, didn't really kite regular enemies
            - never threw daggers or spears at enemies
        - used turn-skipping effectively to fight despite having to click every time
        - NAILED the spider fight!!
        - talked to everyone in the town!
        - feels like there's A LOT of dialog at tombtown + cloning area
        - it's a good thing I tuned down the difficulty of swamps
        - instantly understood trading!
        - just brutalized the frog boss LOL, 14 dmg.. was a bit much hmm...
        - FIGURED OUT WEAPON ACTIVATION (40 minutes in ahhhh)
        - seemed to get a bit fatigued with the item management after a while
            - which is understandable~
        - started throwing potions at the robo fight, and just barely squeaked through
            - my heart was pounding, I can only imagine his, lmao
        - decided to stop playing at the start of the catacombs
        - total playtime 1hr
        
    takeaways:
        - potential for CRITICAL misteachings exist
            - the idea of activating weapons (missed, for a long time)
            - multi-equipping weapons (misunderstood)
            - status effects in general seems to have been missed
            - hovering over enemies to see their stats was missed
            - never found the MAP
        - despite those misunderstandings, had a pretty successful run
            - kinda lucky with items, might have gone differently otherwise
            - made it past robo, not a small feat
            - probably could have made it through catacombs
        - 100% would have quit if he'd died at robo

 - @lofttom (through DM, 01/25/2020 - release day v1.0.0)
    
    "Your game rocks man. Incredible job.
     Inventory management and rerolling the shapes of stuff is a ton of fun and made me feel like i was optimizing
     Went for whip and full life on kill for ez mode"

    - (i said thank you, mentioned playtesters had been having difficulty)
    
    "Im surprised they had a hard time honestly!! But to be fair people never 
     read the readme files lol
     
     Once i figured out the rest system it got easier
     
     Some feedback if you want it:
     Make the dying animation more dramatic, its a little quick
     devoted boyfriend and father
     
     Also an idea: consider a gauntlet mode unlocked for beating the game or 
     something, a chest after each boss or something? Would be cool to hve a 
     quick gamemode for ppl who want to play something fast"
     
    takeaways:
        - someone likes it!! anxiety melting away
        - enemy death animations do suck, lol, should fix
        - rest system is crucial, needs better explained
        - an endless 'survival' mode after the main game would actually be very cool
            - would sorta actually *be* a pure roguelike at that point.
            - endless content requires a lot of content
                - generate "attributes" on enemies
                - boss versions of standard enemies


[pre-beta playtesting notes]

 - coffee shop guy (nervous dog) (7/21/19)
    situation: stranger, asked what i was working on, i offered to let him playtest
    - 45 minutes, made it through 2 levels
    - thought flashing red dagger meant it would break soon
    - couldn't figure out how to pick up items (mouse)
    - couldn't figure out how how to open inventory
    - couldn't figure out how how to rotate items
    - avoided ReturnExitEntity, thought it was fire and would kill him
        - correct behavior, but incorrect reasoning. probably fine?
    - put dagger into inventory instead of equipment grid
    - but figured out how to use the dagger from hotbar without help (pressed 1)
    - lot of awkward hand alternating with controls
    - compulsively picking up, equipping items
        - swapping an rearranging items even when their stats were the same
        - judging items based on color, rather than stats? 
            - thought a yellow item affected speed.
        - eventually became seemingly annoyed whenever an item would drop, would check phone, look away, etc
        - filled up entire inventory with garbage items
    - thought vitality was different from HP
    - seemed bored, playing to pass the time and be polite
        - obv not a fan of the genre, but concerning nonetheless
    - story seemed to amuse him at first, bore him as time went on
    - said art was good, but "programming seems basic"
        - not sure what this means, hurt though lol
    - didn't understand why he couldn't pick up items two squares away
    
    takeaways: 
        - ~early game is slow, easy, confusing, and boring~
        - way too many chests
        - need in-game tutorial
        - shift click to auto-pickup items
        - better indicator when item is too far away to be picked up
        - needs to be possible to die in early levels
        - early levels potentially should be a lot smaller?
        - might want to prevent "ATT" items from being pure yellow
        
 - jeff (home) (8/25/19)
    situation: friend, invited him to playtest
        - 35 minutes, played four games, died at caves 2 or 3 each time
        - most early tutorials in place, game was untuned, pretty hard
    good:
        - equipment and rotation tutorials worked!
        - used item tooltips to decide what to replace when equip space ran out
    neutral:
        - scared of enemies at first, wouldn't fight anything
        - used mouse + inventory hotbar button to open inventory thereafter
    bad:
        - pressed arrow keys before "[WASD]" message appeared, used them throughout
        - had to instruct how to use potions (tried dragging it onto player)
            - didn't really get to see tutorial text because it was on mouse while trying to use it.
        - often tried moving items via drag-n-drop instead of click-move-click
        - rapidly mashed movement keys while fighting, didn't seem to grasp concept of turn-basedness
            - kept doing it after i explained why it wasn't necessary, kept doing it anyways
            - perhaps more of a mental tic in response to stress
        - ran past enemies even whenever possible, causing him to recieve no potions and die in later levels
        - didn't realize you could attack enemies by running into them
        - struggled to equip dagger
            - tried dragging it onto player
            - tried right-clicking it in inventory
            - confused about what "Throwable" meant
            - had to instruct how to select it (there's no in-game explanation for this currently)
        - noticed Zzz's on enemies, but didn't understand what it meant or how to take advantage
            - even after explanation and demonstration, couldn't (immediately~) start fighting slow enemies safely 
        - never tried hovering over enemies to see stats
        
    takeaways:
        - need to streamline the way weapons are equipped. 
            - it should *just work* when you put a weapon into the equipment grid
            - only two attacks available, and a maximum of two weapons equipped
        - there should be a way to recover life at the end of a level
        - drag-n-drop should work
        - disable arrow keys as default controls, it just screws people up
        - need some non-enemy challenges in early levels, to introduce the movement and turn system
        - clicking a potion onto yourself should probably just use it~
        - clicking an equipment onto yourself should equip it if possible
        
        
[beta testing notes]

  date:      1/23/2020
  
  situation: all done remotely on version 0.1.1-BETA , when I asked for 
             volunteers on twitter. sent out private DL links. was mostly
             interested in whether the game would run for everyone.
  - jonny
    - said it was fun, strategic, challenge to get past the first area
    - enjoyed filling up the grid
    - gathered many knives lol
    - said mary explained fighting well
        - (i had given some guidance prior to that)
    - liked the town! talked to the ppl!
  
  - alex
    - chrome & windows both popped 'suspicious file' warnings
        - we must end the tyranny of microsoft and google
    - liked the ASCII map
    - read info.txt before playing, which inspired several strange ideas:
        - thought 'jumping' was a seperate action, that wasn't included in controls menu
        - thought clicking was the prefered way to attack, and running into things was wrong
        - thought filling the grid would do something special 
            - (mostly my fault for jokingly implying it would, lol)
        - tutorials were annoying, because things like opening the map etc. had already been done
            - in a previous run, so the tutorial skip detection didn't work
    - died once (I think) before spider zone
        - "feels like I'm playing wrong"
    - liked spider music, general look & feel, checkpoint design
    - swamps are a big difficulty spike
        - "dying too much"
    - likes the turn counter on load menu
    - ended up pretty underpowered at the swamps, unable to make much progress
        - no potions
        - att: 6, def: 2, vit: 9
    - quit at that point
    - all in all, didn't seem to enjoy the game very much
            
  - dk
    - runs well on his potato
    - got to the swamps
        - quit to get dinner
    - came back
    - slugs were tough
        - is it optimistic to assume players won't get hit by slugs?
    - it FAILED TO SAVE
        - could still continue from checkpoints (good)
        - but no save_data directory was ever created
        - after flipping the read-only flag on the 'Skeletris' folder it became fixed?
        - although that shouldn't matter
        - unclear if he restarted the game after flipping the box to make it work or what
        - the real issue here is that there's no way to diagnose this problem remotely
    - went silent as we were investigating the saving issue
    
  - necro
    - runs well, likes the feel
    - didn't play too long, enjoyed it though
    - claimed to quit for IRL reasons
    
  - av reference
    - sent me a very detailed list of his thoughts, super helpful:

        "Hi there! I downloaded and successfully run the game on Windows 10. 
         Here are some considerations after some time playing; I arrived to 
         the first save point and the swamps."

        "1. I like the graphic and music very much but if you are planning to 
            sell it some people would aspect more atmosphere and details."
        "2. I found some fx sounds to be slightly louder, like when you are hit 
            by an enemy or when you heal with a potion."
        "3. The game runs smooth; custom controls are perfect as some people like 
            me prefer to use arrows rather than wasd."
        "4. The idea of fitting items like a puzzle is very nice."
        "5. Why would you skip a turn? There seems to be a lack of information 
            about that. The jump is cute!"
        "6. I like the map; sometimes it didn't show the doors, other times it 
            did with a O."
        "7. The saved data load perfectly."
        
        - beginning isn't engaging enough
            - should think about improving this post-release
            
        - should dial back the potion / damage sounds a bit perhaps?
            - reduce default sound effects volume?  (FIXED in v0.1.3-BETA)
            
        - improve mary's dialog to include some info about turn skipping?
            - or put some info in the store page
            - if players can't learn this they'll likely be unable to progress
            
        - likely some confusion about doors going away when they're opened
            - tested to make sure and it seems to work correctly
            - yep
  
  takeaways: 
    - it ran well on everybody's computers!! (all used windows, I believe)
        - except for DK whose game was failing to write anything to disk
            - fixed by jibbling the 'read-only' checkbox on the folder??
    - but people didn't seem to want to play for very long
    - swamps was a major dropping off point
        - not sure why though, exactly
            - crabs, ghasts, and cyclopses, might be a bit much (FIXED? by v0.1.2)
    - remote "playtesting" is so bad compared to in-person
        - obviously...
    - need better handling for when the game is unable to write to disk
        - logging wouldn't help here (can't write logs either...)
        - pop a message with the stacktrace to the screen maybe?
            - when? at save time?
            - this is so messy
        - can instruct people to run the game the game through a terminal, take screenshot
          of stacktrace in console if necessary
    - game data should be be saved to the OS's AppData folder, not the working directory (FIXED by v0.1.3)
        - this is likely the root cause of DK's saving issue
        - although it's unclear why it couldn't write to the desktop or why
          closing and reopening the game fixed those issues...
