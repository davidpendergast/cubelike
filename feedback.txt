[beta release feedback]

 - @lofttom (through DM, 01/25/2020 - release day v1.0.0)
    
    "Your game rocks man. Incredible job.
     Inventory management and rerolling the shapes of stuff is a ton of fun and made me feel like i was optimizing
     Went for whip and full life on kill for ez mode"

    - (i said thank you, mentioned playtesters had been having difficulty)
    
    "Im surprised they had a hard time honestly!! But to be fair people never 
     read the readme files lol
     
     Once i figured out the rest system it got easier
     
     Some feedback if you want it:
     Make the dying animation more dramatic, its a little quick
     devoted boyfriend and father
     
     Also an idea: consider a gauntlet mode unlocked for beating the game or 
     something, a chest after each boss or something? Would be cool to hve a 
     quick gamemode for ppl who want to play something fast"
     
    takeaways:
        - someone likes it!! anxiety melting away
        - enemy death animations do suck, lol, should fix
        - rest system is crucial, needs better explained
        - an endless 'survival' mode after the main game would actually be very cool
            - would sorta actually *be* a pure roguelike at that point.
            - endless content requires a lot of content
                - generate "attributes" on enemies
                - boss versions of standard enemies


[pre-beta playtesting notes]

 - coffee shop guy (nervous dog) (7/21/19)
    situation: stranger, asked what i was working on, i offered to let him playtest
    - 45 minutes, made it through 2 levels
    - thought flashing red dagger meant it would break soon
    - couldn't figure out how to pick up items (mouse)
    - couldn't figure out how how to open inventory
    - couldn't figure out how how to rotate items
    - avoided ReturnExitEntity, thought it was fire and would kill him
        - correct behavior, but incorrect reasoning. probably fine?
    - put dagger into inventory instead of equipment grid
    - but figured out how to use the dagger from hotbar without help (pressed 1)
    - lot of awkward hand alternating with controls
    - compulsively picking up, equipping items
        - swapping an rearranging items even when their stats were the same
        - judging items based on color, rather than stats? 
            - thought a yellow item affected speed.
        - eventually became seemingly annoyed whenever an item would drop, would check phone, look away, etc
        - filled up entire inventory with garbage items
    - thought vitality was different from HP
    - seemed bored, playing to pass the time and be polite
        - obv not a fan of the genre, but concerning nonetheless
    - story seemed to amuse him at first, bore him as time went on
    - said art was good, but "programming seems basic"
        - not sure what this means, hurt though lol
    - didn't understand why he couldn't pick up items two squares away
    
    takeaways: 
        - ~early game is slow, easy, confusing, and boring~
        - way too many chests
        - need in-game tutorial
        - shift click to auto-pickup items
        - better indicator when item is too far away to be picked up
        - needs to be possible to die in early levels
        - early levels potentially should be a lot smaller?
        - might want to prevent "ATT" items from being pure yellow
        
 - jeff (home) (8/25/19)
    situation: friend, invited him to playtest
        - 35 minutes, played four games, died at caves 2 or 3 each time
        - most early tutorials in place, game was untuned, pretty hard
    good:
        - equipment and rotation tutorials worked!
        - used item tooltips to decide what to replace when equip space ran out
    neutral:
        - scared of enemies at first, wouldn't fight anything
        - used mouse + inventory hotbar button to open inventory thereafter
    bad:
        - pressed arrow keys before "[WASD]" message appeared, used them throughout
        - had to instruct how to use potions (tried dragging it onto player)
            - didn't really get to see tutorial text because it was on mouse while trying to use it.
        - often tried moving items via drag-n-drop instead of click-move-click
        - rapidly mashed movement keys while fighting, didn't seem to grasp concept of turn-basedness
            - kept doing it after i explained why it wasn't necessary, kept doing it anyways
            - perhaps more of a mental tic in response to stress
        - ran past enemies even whenever possible, causing him to recieve no potions and die in later levels
        - didn't realize you could attack enemies by running into them
        - struggled to equip dagger
            - tried dragging it onto player
            - tried right-clicking it in inventory
            - confused about what "Throwable" meant
            - had to instruct how to select it (there's no in-game explanation for this currently)
        - noticed Zzz's on enemies, but didn't understand what it meant or how to take advantage
            - even after explanation and demonstration, couldn't (immediately~) start fighting slow enemies safely 
        - never tried hovering over enemies to see stats
        
    takeaways:
        - need to streamline the way weapons are equipped. 
            - it should *just work* when you put a weapon into the equipment grid
            - only two attacks available, and a maximum of two weapons equipped
        - there should be a way to recover life at the end of a level
        - drag-n-drop should work
        - disable arrow keys as default controls, it just screws people up
        - need some non-enemy challenges in early levels, to introduce the movement and turn system
        - clicking a potion onto yourself should probably just use it~
        - clicking an equipment onto yourself should equip it if possible
        
        
[beta testing notes]

  date:      1/23/2020
  
  situation: all done remotely on version 0.1.1-BETA , when I asked for 
             volunteers on twitter. sent out private DL links. was mostly
             interested in whether the game would run for everyone.
  - jonny
    - said it was fun, strategic, challenge to get past the first area
    - enjoyed filling up the grid
    - gathered many knives lol
    - said mary explained fighting well
        - (i had given some guidance prior to that)
    - liked the town! talked to the ppl!
  
  - alex
    - chrome & windows both popped 'suspicious file' warnings
        - we must end the tyranny of microsoft and google
    - liked the ASCII map
    - read info.txt before playing, which inspired several strange ideas:
        - thought 'jumping' was a seperate action, that wasn't included in controls menu
        - thought clicking was the prefered way to attack, and running into things was wrong
        - thought filling the grid would do something special 
            - (mostly my fault for jokingly implying it would, lol)
        - tutorials were annoying, because things like opening the map etc. had already been done
            - in a previous run, so the tutorial skip detection didn't work
    - died once (I think) before spider zone
        - "feels like I'm playing wrong"
    - liked spider music, general look & feel, checkpoint design
    - swamps are a big difficulty spike
        - "dying too much"
    - likes the turn counter on load menu
    - ended up pretty underpowered at the swamps, unable to make much progress
        - no potions
        - att: 6, def: 2, vit: 9
    - quit at that point
    - all in all, didn't seem to enjoy the game very much
            
  - dk
    - runs well on his potato
    - got to the swamps
        - quit to get dinner
    - came back
    - slugs were tough
        - is it optimistic to assume players won't get hit by slugs?
    - it FAILED TO SAVE
        - could still continue from checkpoints (good)
        - but no save_data directory was ever created
        - after flipping the read-only flag on the 'Skeletris' folder it became fixed?
        - although that shouldn't matter
        - unclear if he restarted the game after flipping the box to make it work or what
        - the real issue here is that there's no way to diagnose this problem remotely
    - went silent as we were investigating the saving issue
    
  - necro
    - runs well, likes the feel
    - didn't play too long, enjoyed it though
    - claimed to quit for IRL reasons
    
  - av reference
    - sent me a very detailed list of his thoughts, super helpful:

        "Hi there! I downloaded and successfully run the game on Windows 10. 
         Here are some considerations after some time playing; I arrived to 
         the first save point and the swamps."

        "1. I like the graphic and music very much but if you are planning to 
            sell it some people would aspect more atmosphere and details."
        "2. I found some fx sounds to be slightly louder, like when you are hit 
            by an enemy or when you heal with a potion."
        "3. The game runs smooth; custom controls are perfect as some people like 
            me prefer to use arrows rather than wasd."
        "4. The idea of fitting items like a puzzle is very nice."
        "5. Why would you skip a turn? There seems to be a lack of information 
            about that. The jump is cute!"
        "6. I like the map; sometimes it didn't show the doors, other times it 
            did with a O."
        "7. The saved data load perfectly."
        
        - beginning isn't engaging enough
            - should think about improving this post-release
            
        - should dial back the potion / damage sounds a bit perhaps?
            - reduce default sound effects volume?  (FIXED in v0.1.3-BETA)
            
        - improve mary's dialog to include some info about turn skipping?
            - or put some info in the store page
            - if players can't learn this they'll likely be unable to progress
            
        - likely some confusion about doors going away when they're opened
            - tested to make sure and it seems to work correctly
            - yep
  
  takeaways: 
    - it ran well on everybody's computers!! (all used windows, I believe)
        - except for DK whose game was failing to write anything to disk
            - fixed by jibbling the 'read-only' checkbox on the folder??
    - but people didn't seem to want to play for very long
    - swamps was a major dropping off point
        - not sure why though, exactly
            - crabs, ghasts, and cyclopses, might be a bit much (FIXED? by v0.1.2)
    - remote "playtesting" is so bad compared to in-person
        - obviously...
    - need better handling for when the game is unable to write to disk
        - logging wouldn't help here (can't write logs either...)
        - pop a message with the stacktrace to the screen maybe?
            - when? at save time?
            - this is so messy
        - can instruct people to run the game the game through a terminal, take screenshot
          of stacktrace in console if necessary
    - game data should be be saved to the OS's AppData folder, not the working directory (FIXED by v0.1.3)
        - this is likely the root cause of DK's saving issue
        - although it's unclear why it couldn't write to the desktop or why
          closing and reopening the game fixed those issues...
