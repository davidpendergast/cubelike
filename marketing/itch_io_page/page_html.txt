Don't stack weapons! They don't buff each other, so it's a waste of precious space. Use one (or two, at most) weapons at a time, and support them with artifacts. Switch between weapons using the number keys or the hotbar at the bottom of the screen.


If you do decide to equip multiple weapons (like a sword and a whip, in this example), use the number keys 1-6 to select which one to activate.  Again, their bonuses do not stack.
