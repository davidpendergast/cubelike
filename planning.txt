1. Stats + Attributes

        Core Stats:
            Attack (ATT)  
                - range 10-255
                - determines damage dealt by a successful hit
                - E(damage_dealt) = ATT
                    - (expected value of dmg == ATT, distribution TBD)
            Defense (DEF)    
                - range 10-255
                - determines chance to be hit and chance to get hit
                - chance_to_hit = max(1.0, 2 * DEF / (DEF + enemy_def))
            Vitality (VIT)    
                - range 10-255
                - determines max hp
                - HP = 4.0 * vit * (1 + 0.1*level)
            Level (LVL)

2. Controls 

    Game:
        [WASD] to move
        [Space] to attack
        [E] drink potion
        [I] open inventory
        [Tab] to inspect items on ground
            - [Space] (or walk out of range) to exit inspection mode
        [esc] pause
    
    Inventory:
        [I] or [esc] to exit inventory/replace held item
        [left click] to pick up/place down equipment
        [left release] place item if dragging and position is valid
        [right click] to rotate (cw) held equipment
        [shift right click] to rotate (ccw) held equipment
        
        (game continues running while inventory is open, so those controls
        still do the same things)
        
    Menus:
        [WASD] or [mouse] to navigate menus
        [ENTER], [Space], or [click] 
        [esc] return, where applicable
        
    - all remappable via a config file.
           
                  
3. Combat System
    
    a. Ready to Attack Mode (RTAM)
        - initiated by pressing [Space]
        - shows a visual indicator of the player's attack range
            - red outline of the attack radius
    
    b. Attacking Mode
        - shows a different visual indicator
            - translucent red circle that pulses outward with each attack
        - initiated by a target entering attack radius of RTAM
        - player and enemy speed is reduced 
        - first attack lands instantly, subsequent ones are delivered on a timer
        - if multiple targets are in radius, attack is applied randomly
            - with priority given to living targets (non-chests and non-doors)
        - visual effect to show which target was hit + sound played
        - Attack Mode becomes RTAM if all targets die or leave radius
        - Attack Mode ends if [Space] is released

    
4. Equipment System

        - equipment is made of 5, 6, or 7 "cubes"
        - arrangement must fit within a 5x5 grid
        - cubes must touch each other via edges, not diagonals
        - cube color determined by stat ratio
        - visual distinction for bonus stats
        - appears on ground as "Cuboid of Haste (6, +2)"
        
        Randomized attributes:
            Level:
                - range (1-64)
                - determined by dungeon level, affects stat ranges
            # of cubes:
                - range (5-7)
                - 60% for 5, 30% for 6, and 10% for 7
            Primary Stat:
                - ATT, DEF, or VIT
                - determines primary color of equipment
                - determines primary stat or equipment
                - determines prefix (Cube, Tetra, or Quadra)
            Secondary Stat:
                - ATT, DEF, or VIT
                - determines secondary color of equipment
                - determines secondary stat or equipment
                - determines suffix (-cube, -oid, or -shape)
                - may match primary stat
            Bonus Stat 1:
                - chooses a random attribute
                - 50% chance of appearing
                - determines end of item name (e.g. "of Haste")
            Bonus Stat 2:
                - must have 6+ cubes and Bonus Stat 1
                - 33% chance of appearing (cumm. 16.7%)
            Bonus Stat 3:
                - must have 7+ cubes and a Bonus Stat 2
                - 25% chance of appearing (cumm 4.2%)
            Special Stat:
                - determined by shape of equipment.
                - always added to pieces that match the requirements
                - determines leading adjective in name (e.g. "Holy")

5. Potion System

    - potions are collectable consumables that heal the player when used
    - base healing is 10 (can be additively increased via attributes)
    - base cooldown is 3 seconds (reducible via attributes)
    - play sound when consumed
    - enemies and chests have a chance to drop (1-3) potions when destroyed
    - icon in corner shows number of potions + cooldown
    
6. Inventory System
    - picture of player
    - player base stats
        - hover for all stats
    - backpack 5 by X with tabs
    - equipment slots (5x5 grid)
    - takes up half the screen 
        -the other half keeps displaying the game which is still running

7. Dungeon
    - dungeon is a series of rooms connected by doors
    - rooms are not visible until an adjacent room is opened
    - the interior of rooms (enemies) is not revealed until the room is opened
        - chests inside rooms are revealed
    - opening a room:
        - enemies are spawned (number and strength depends on dungeon level)
        - 0-3 enemy groups per room (bigger rooms, higher DLVL -> more groups)
        - chests are filled
        - adjacent unrevealed rooms are revealed  
    - dungeon rooms are produced with group spawn pads
        - number of spawn pads determine number of groups per room

8. Enemy Spawning
    - spawn in groups of 1-7
        - higher DLVL -> bigger groups 
        - more enemies in group -> weaker enemies
        
        
9. Enemy Generation
    - exact same stats + attack system as player
        - except -30% base movement speed
    - enemies have a level and a type
        - level determines:
            - stats
                - f(level) = total_stats -> distributed to (ATT, DEF, VIT)
        - type determines: 
            - stats per level (aka difficulty of enemy)
            - art (colorized based on stats ofc)
            - fixed attributes
            - # of random attributes
        Example:
            Wild Hornbeast (LVL 10)
                ATT: 120
                DEF: 130
                VIT: 75
                +25% Movement speed while attacking
                
10. Enemy AI
    - enemies have states: IDLE, PROVOKING, CHASING, ATTACKING
    
    IDLE:
        - wandering around
        - but tend to stay grouped
        - they may pass through each other but prefer not to
        - every enemy has a provoke radius (shared per-group, determined by lvl)
            - when player enters an IDLE enemy's provoke radius:
                - that enemy becomes PROVOKING
    
    PROVOKING: 
        - pauses for a sec
        - plays an animation (exclamation mark probably)
        - all IDLE enemies (from group) in provoke radius become PROVOKING 
        - state changes to CHASING
             
    CHASING:
        - enemy pathfinds towards player
            - softly trying to avoid other enemies but no hard restrictions
        - every enemy has a follow radius (determined by level)
            - an enemy stops chasing both are true:
                - the player has left its follow radius
                - a certain (random per-enemy) time period has passed
        - when player enters 2x attack radius, enters combat mode
            - same as player's, red circle shows, etc
        - when player leaves 2x attack radius, leaves combat mode
        
10. Enemy Loot
    - each enemy has a chance to drop an item upon death
    - item level will match enemy level
    - chances should be tuned to give about:
        - 1 equipment per room 
        - 1-2 ish potions per room 

11. Doors
    - all rooms are connected by doors
    - doors are opened by the player walking into it for a bit
    
12. Chests
    - slightly smaller than wall size
    - nudged against adjacent walls if there are any
    - block movement
    - can't be opened until room's enemies are cleared
    - opened by walking into it
    - opening has a low delay and progress bar - for suspense
        - interruptable by enemy attacks
    - drops 1-4 items, same item level as dungeon
    - drops 1-3 potions
    - items/potions are strewn on floor as if an enemy died
    - items have increased chances of being higher number of cubes 

13. Dungeon Generation
    - ok this is where it gets hard
    Goals:
        - big rooms connected by medium size rooms
        - different "feels" of rooms to add variety
            - rectangular
            - organic
        - narrow hallways should denote optional paths <- gud idea
