~ ghast learns about music ~

study 1: baba is you theme (Baba is You)

    - length: 2 minutes

    - bassline & bass drum loops through whole song
    - hints of melody start on 2nd loop 
    - full melody starts on 4th loop

    - pitch up at 30 seconds
    - followed by pitch down + melody change
    - and then it goes back, stronger w/ drums
    - and slight variation of melody

    - at 1 minute, new instrument different melody, louder
        - old melody keeps going underneath

    - at 1:20, back to old melody, but everything loud + clear
    - at 1:30, launches into a quite different, louder brighter bassline/instrument
        - and main melody instrument drops out
        
    - loops back into intro at about 1:50
    
study 2: wall is stop; starting off (Baba is You)

    - length: 2 minutes
    
    - starts with bassline + hi-hat and drum drum
    - hints of melody start after two "bars"
    - then melody plays for two bars

    - then new instrument comes in at 30 seconds, compliments melody
    
    - bassline changes (slows down) at 50 seconds, melody drops out
    - drumline goes a little funky while this happens
    - at 1 minute, bassline stays different, melody comes back in
        - both melody instruments, and it's louder and a bit different
    
    - this repeats until 1:30, when bassline drops out for two bars 
        - while melody instrument and drums continue
    - at 1:45 or so bassline comes back in for a couple bars and loops back into intro
    
    
the baba formula: 
    - 2 minute loop
    - drums play entire time, never fall out or get too heavy
    - two main basslines + one small fancy bassline
    - two main melodies, and two instruments that contribute to melody
        - one main one, one supporting one
        - (do they call this the "lead" and the "rhythm" sections?)
        - neither should smother the song while playing (leave "room to breathe")
    - something must drastically change at 30, 60, 90, 120 seconds
    
key takeaways:
    - things get boring after 30 seconds
    - but old things feel new again after hearing three other, different things
