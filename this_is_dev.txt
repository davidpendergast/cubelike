When the game is launched, it'll switch to dev mode if it sees this file
(or any file named "this_is_dev.txt") in the working directory. 

dev commands can be used in-game by pressing F6.

If you load a legitimate save file in dev mode, it'll permanently mark that
file's version as "DEV", and it won't show up in the high score menu anymore. 
So be careful if you care about that.
